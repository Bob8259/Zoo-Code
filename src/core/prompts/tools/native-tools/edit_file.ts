const EDIT_FILE_DESCRIPTION = `Replace text in an existing file or create a new file via literal string replacement.

Usage Patterns:
1. Modify Existing File: Provide file_path, old_string, and new_string. Default is exactly 1 occurrence. Use expected_replacements for multiple occurrences.
2. Create New File: Set old_string to empty string "". new_string becomes the content.

Critical Requirements:
- Match old_string exactly, including whitespace, indentation, and punctuation.
- For single replacements, include at least 3 lines of context before and after the target text to ensure uniqueness.
- Do not escape special characters.`
